description: The illumos project develops a Unix operating system core that was
    originally derived from OpenSolaris, providing next-generation features for
    downstream distributions, including advanced system debugging, next
    generation filesystem, networking, and virtualization options.<p>
    illumos is developed by both volunteers and companies building products
    based on the illumos system.<p>
    illumos is an excellent base for both traditional and cloud-native
    deployments.<p>

    Come and chat with illumos developers, users, and creators of distributions!
    We'll be here to talk about illumos and answer questions.<p>
    We'll try to be around in the FOSDEM Matrix chat, but if you're like us and
    prefer IRC, please visit us on #illumos on libera.chat. If you don't
    have an IRC client, try <a href="https://web.libera.chat">libera's
